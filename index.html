                    <h2> Awaker Of Muslims </h2>
                    <p>
                        <b>True universal heroes rise from humble </b> beginnings to make a universal impact as
                        visionaries for
                        all times. Allama Muhammad Iqbal was one such hero who was born on the 9th of November 1877 in
                        Sialkot and died on the 21st of April, 1938, a few years before the making of Pakistan. On the
                        14th of August on the birthday of Pakistan there is no better time than to remember Allama
                        Iqbal, the national poet and one of the founding fathers of Pakistan, who is known in the
                        vernacular as Shair-e-Mashriq or the Poet of the East. His ideas inspired the making of Pakistan
                        and the Founder of Pakistan, Quaid-e-Azam. Allama Iqbal was a philosopher-scholar of Islam:
                        Allama meaning scholar; he is also known as Muffakir-e-Pakistan i.e. the Thinker of Pakistan.
                        One is immediately reminded of Iqbal’s now famous signature pose of his hand on his forehead in
                        a pensive reflective manner. As a lawyer, theorist, politician, writer – a polymath – he is also
                        known as Hakeem-ul-Ummat or the Sage of the Ummah of the community of the believers.
